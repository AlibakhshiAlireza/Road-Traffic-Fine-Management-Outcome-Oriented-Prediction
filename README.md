  <h1>Road Traffic Fine Management Project</h1>
  <p>This repository contains the code and data for the Road Traffic Fine Management project. In this project, we worked with a dataset related to road traffic fines and performed various tasks, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, dimensionality transformation, and building a machine learning model to predict traffic violations.</p>

  <h2>Dataset Description</h2>
  <p>The dataset used in this project is called "Road Traffic Fine Management" dataset. It includes information about traffic violations, such as date and time of the violation, vehicle details, violation type, and fine amount.</p>

  <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>
  <p>We conducted an exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset. This involved data visualization, statistical analysis, and understanding the distribution and patterns of traffic violations.</p>

  <h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
  <p>Before building the machine learning model, we preprocessed the data to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data quality. Data preprocessing is a critical step to prepare the dataset for training the model.</p>

  <h2>Dimensionality Transformation</h2>
  <p>To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the machine learning model, we applied dimensionality transformation techniques to reduce the number of features while preserving essential information.</p>

  <h2>Machine Learning Model</h2>
  <p>We developed a machine learning model to predict traffic violations based on the preprocessed data. The model achieved an impressive accuracy of 92% on the test set.</p>

  <h2>Code</h2>
  <p>The code for this project is available in the Jupyter Notebook file named <code>BPI_DATASET.ipynb</code>. It contains detailed explanations of the steps performed, from data loading to model building and evaluation.</p>

  <p>Feel free to explore the notebook to understand our analysis, methods, and results.</p>

  <p>If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.</p>

  <p>Happy coding!</p>
